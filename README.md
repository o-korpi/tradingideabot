# Trading Idea Bot
---

Small bot that's analyzes a set list of securities using a few strategies (currently EMA 10 / EMA 21 cross and another strategy using Ichimoku), sends a message in DMs on discord if the bot thinks that a certain security should be bought. Far from perfect, can (and will) trigger false signals, should not be used as financial advice.
